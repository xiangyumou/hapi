# Contributing to HAPI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HAPI! We welcome bug fixes, feature suggestions, and thoughtful contributions from the community.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be friendly and respectful** - Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism
- **Help others** - Share knowledge and assist fellow contributors
- **Give constructive feedback** - Focus on the code, not the person
- **Be patient** - Remember that everyone has different experience levels

## AI-Generated Code Policy (Vibe Coding)

If you are using AI tools to generate code ("Vibe Coding"), please note:

**We only accept code generated by the GPT-5.2-codex model.**

Pull requests containing code generated by other AI models (including other GPT versions, Claude, or any other LLM) will be rejected. This policy helps us maintain consistency and quality standards across the codebase.

If you're unsure whether your AI-assisted code meets this requirement, please open an issue to discuss before submitting.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### No Mega PRs

We do not accept oversized pull requests that introduce large features all at once. Large PRs are:

- Difficult to review thoroughly
- More likely to introduce bugs
- Harder to revert if issues arise

**If you want to add a significant feature, please open an issue first to discuss the approach.** We can help break it down into smaller, reviewable chunks.

### PR Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused on a single concern
- Write clear commit messages
- Include relevant tests if applicable
- Update documentation if needed
- Reference related issues in your PR description

## Bug Reports

Bug reports are always welcome! When reporting a bug, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Node/Bun version, etc.)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
